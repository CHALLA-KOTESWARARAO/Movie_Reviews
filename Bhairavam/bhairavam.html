        <h4>Bhairavam is the latest Telugu action drama featuring Bellamkonda Sai Sreenivas, Manchu Manoj, and 
Nara Rohith in the lead roles. Amid decent pre-release buzz, the film has finally hit the screens today. 
Let’s see how it fares.</h4>

        <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
Gajapathi Varma (Manchu Manoj) and Varadha (Nara Rohith) have been inseparable since childhood. 

Seenu (Bellamkonda Sai Sreenivas), an orphan, becomes a part of their lives following a life-altering 

incident in their early years.

A powerful minister (Sharath Lohithaswa) sets his sights on grabbing the valuable land of a sacred 

temple and ropes in CI Pardha Sarathi (Sampath Raj) to help execute his plan.

As the situation escalates, cracks begin to form between the friends, turning loyalty into betrayal. 

The rest of the story unravels the consequences of this betrayal and the bloodshed that follows in 

their once-harmonious lives.
</pre>

        <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Bellamkonda Sai Sreenivas delivers one of his most emotionally layered performances to date. 

His character demands a wide range of emotions, and he portrays them with surprising ease, 

showcasing noticeable growth as an actor.

Nara Rohith stands out with a composed and mature performance. He brings grace and restraint 

to his role and leaves a strong impression.

Manchu Manoj packs a punch with his intense portrayal. His deep voice, powerful expressions, and 

sharp dialogue delivery give his character a commanding presence.

The action sequences are a major highlight – particularly the interval block and the brutal 

transformation scene featuring Bellamkonda Sreenivas. These segments are sure to impress 

mass-movie fans.

Divya Pillai is given a role with substance and delivers it with conviction. Supporting actors like 

Sampath Raj and Ajay turn in dependable performances, adding value to the narrative.

</pre>

        <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
The film’s storyline is relatively straightforward and can be grasped within the first few minutes. 

For such a simple plot, the treatment and narrative depth are crucial, but that’s where the film falters. 

The screenplay lacks the gripping quality needed to hold the viewer’s attention throughout.

While the first half is decently structured, the second half slows down considerably. The pacing dips 

and a lack of engaging sequences make it feel stretched in parts.

Although the lead characters are well-written, their emotional bond isn’t effectively translated onto 

the screen. The film tells us about their friendship more than it shows it, resulting in missed 

emotional impact.

Characters like Aditi Shankar, Aanandhi, and Vennela Kishore are underdeveloped and add little 

to the story. Aditi Shankar, in particular, is reduced to just a couple of songs and a few 

inconsequential scenes, which is a clear waste of her presence.

The songs themselves don’t leave a lasting impression and fail to elevate the narrative.
</pre>

        <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Director Vijay Kanakamedala doesn’t quite hit the mark with this remake of Garudan. 

While the potential for a gripping emotional action drama is evident, the lack of strong character 

development and narrative tightness holds the film back. A more focused and intense screenplay 

could have significantly improved the impact.

Hari K Vedantham’s cinematography is decent and supports the film’s tone well. 

Sricharan Pakala’s background score adds emotional weight where needed. However, 

Chota K Prasad’s editing could have been crisper. The production values are solid and support 

the film’s scale.
</pre>

        <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
On the whole, Bhairavam is an action drama that works to an extent. 

Bellamkonda Sai Sreenivas’s improved performance, Nara Rohith’s restraint, and Manchu Manoj’s 

negative portrayal are the film’s strengths. The action set-pieces are well-executed and will cater 

to mass audiences.

However, a predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and a sluggish second half limit its overall 

impact. It’s best to go in with tempered expectations if you’re still planning to watch it.
