        <h4>Nani is in top form with back-to-back hits in his career. But with HIT 3, he has taken things to another level as he plays a ruthless cop for the first time. Directed by Sailesh Kolanu, HIT 3 has hit the screens today and let’s see if it lives up to all the hype created.</h4>

        <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
Arjun Sarkaar (Nani) is a ruthless cop who commits a heinous murder. This is also the time he finds out 

that different murders at various locations are happening in the same manner.

The plot is simple: Who is behind these murders? Did Arjun crack the case? Why is he so ruthless and 

what is the basic backdrop?

To know the answers, watch the film on the big screen.
</pre>

        <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Nani is undoubtedly the major attraction of HIT 3. His new action-packed avatar will shock everyone. 

Be it his look or dialogue delivery, Nani has nailed it.

The first half is an investigation drama and sets the tone well. The latter part is filled with brutal 

action that has rarely been showcased in recent Telugu films.

HIT 3 has stylish cameos, and all were well-executed. Srinidhi Shetty shines in her role and has 

excellent chemistry with Nani. 

Rao Ramesh, Komalee Prasad, and others do justice to their parts.

Prateek Babbar makes a solid Telugu debut and suits the psycho role well. The emotional depth and 

reason behind Arjun’s behavior is nicely justified in the story.

The last 20 minutes are intense and offer high-octane drama and action.
</pre>

        <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
HIT 3 is strictly for adults and not suitable for family audiences due to its excessive violence. 

Some scenes are quite disturbing.

The film doesn’t have many surprising twists and becomes more of a survival thriller in the second half.

The screenplay could have been tighter. More gripping drama and variety in scenes were needed to elevate 

the narrative.

The first half, though investigative, runs on a plain note with less impactful sequences.
</pre>

        <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Mickey J Meyer’s music is decent, but the background score in the first half could have been better. 

Songs are well-placed.

Top-notch production values, especially the VFX and brutal action choreography.

Editing by Karthika Srinivas is crisp and effective. The art and set work for the action blocks deserve 

a mention.

Director Sailesh Kolanu impresses with a gritty thriller and showcases Nani in a never-seen-before 

ruthless avatar. A few more twists and a stronger villain would have taken the film a notch higher.
</pre>

        <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
On the whole, HIT 3 is a pulsating survival thriller packed with mad action. Nani’s fierce performance 

steals the show. The violence might not suit everyone, especially family audiences. But for action film 

lovers, HIT 3 is a gripping and intense experience. Go for it!
