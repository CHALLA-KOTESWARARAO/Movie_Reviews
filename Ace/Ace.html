<h4>Makkal Selvan Vijay Sethupathi’s latest film Ace has hit the screens in both Tamil and Telugu. It also marks the Tamil debut of actress Rukmini Vasanth. Let’s see how this crime-comedy fares.</h4>


<h2>Story:</h2>

<pre>Bolt Kashi (Vijay Sethupathi) lands in Malaysia in search of work and meets Jyanam (Yogi Babu), who helps him find a job. 

During this time, Kashi crosses paths with Rukmini (Rukmini Vasanth), a woman struggling with financial issues. 

Hoping to help her, Kashi turns to poker for quick money. However, his opponent Dharma (BS Avinash), a ruthless gangster,

cheats him, and Kashi ends up owing him a significant amount, which he promises to repay within a week. Out of options, Kashi plans robbery. 

What follows is a sequence of events that reveal whether he pulls off the heist, whether Rukmini knows about the plan, and what role RajaDorai 

(Babloo Prithveeraj) plays in his life.</pre>

<h2>Plus Points:</h2>

<pre>
Vijay Sethupathi brings his signature calmness and expressive subtlety to the role. He handles few scenes and even action moments with his 
    
usual understated ease.Yogi Babu tries to bring in some comic relief. A few of his one-liners land well, especially early on. Rukmini Vasanth

looks convincing in her role, though her character doesn’t offer her much emotional or dramatic range.Supporting actors like Divya Pillai, 

Babloo Prithveeraj, and BS Avinash do their part without making much of an impact, but they fit their roles fine.
    </pre>
<h2>Minus Points:</h2>

<pre>
The biggest problem with Ace lies in its predictable story and sluggish execution. The pacing is slow from the beginning and remains 

that way throughout, draining the film of any tension or excitement.Although the film aims to mix crime, romance, and comedy,

none of these elements is explored deeply enough. The transitions between tones feel uneven and the script lacks focus.</pre>
<h2>Technical Aspects:</h2><pre>
Arumuga Kumar’s writing and direction fail to elevate a simple story into something watchable. The screenplay lacks energy 

the storytelling feels outdated.Karan B Rawat’s cinematography is decent, and Sam CS’s background score doesn’t do much to enhance the mood. 

While production values are adequate, the editing is noticeably weak – several scenes could have been trimmed to improve pace. </pre>
<h2>Verdict:</h2><pre>
On the whole, Ace is a bland and forgettable film that falls short on both story and execution. Vijay Sethupathi puts in a sincere effort, 

but it’s not nearly enough to rescue the film from its sluggish pace and underwhelming writing. While there are a few scattered moments 

that try to lighten the mood, they aren’t enough to make this a satisfying watch. It’s best to explore other entertainment options instead.
