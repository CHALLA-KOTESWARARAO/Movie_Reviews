        <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
Set in Vizag, Arjun Vishwanath (Kalyan Ram) is the son of an honest IPS officer, Vyjayanthi (Vijayashanti). 

She dreams of seeing her son become an IPS officer like her. When everything seems to be going well, an 

unexpected situation separates them. Vyjayanthi cuts Arjun off from her life, and in the meantime, 

he turns into a criminal who protects the people of Vizag.

Enter Pathaan (Sohail Khan), a man seeking revenge against Vyjayanthi. Who is Pathaan? Why does he want 

to kill Vyjayanthi? Why does Vyjayanthi abandon her son? Why does Arjun become a criminal? 

Do mother and son reunite? The film unfolds the answers to these questions.
</pre>

        <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Although the story is familiar, the way it’s handled is commendable. The screenplay moves neatly, making 

the film feel pleasing despite its foreseeable plot.

Kalyan Ram delivers a solid performance as Arjun, a son who deeply cares about his mother’s safety. 

His action scenes are well-executed and add weight to his character.

Vijayashanti gets a meaningful role and performs it perfectly. Her emotional and confrontational scenes 

with Kalyan Ram are compelling.

The action sequences are stylish and will appeal to fans of the genre. The twist in the climax adds an 

interesting layer to the narrative.

Supporting actors like Animal Babloo, Srikanth, and Sohail Khan do a decent job within the scope of 

their characters.
</pre>

        <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
While the director succeeds in presenting a routine story decently, stronger emotional depth and better 

dialogues could have made the film more impactful.

Some scenes, in both halves, feel over the top. Trimming such sequences could have improved the film’s 

overall flow and realism.

There are noticeable logical loopholes. For instance, a scene where a character reaches the shore by 

holding onto a piece of cloth tied to a boat feels unrealistic. Several such moments exist in the name 

of cinematic liberty. If you can overlook them, the film remains enjoyable.

Saiee Manjrekar’s character is underwritten and adds little to the narrative. Her role could have been 

developed with more depth. The songs are passable but lack the impact of being memorable.
</pre>

        <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Director Pradeep Chilukuri does a fine job in presenting a routine story with decent narration. 

However, a sharper focus on emotional writing and dialogues would have elevated the film.

Srikanth Vissa’s screenplay is decent. Ram Prasad’s cinematography is visually pleasing, and Thammiraju’s 

editing is crisp. The runtime is well-balanced. Production values are decent.

Ajaneesh Loknath’s music works well for the most part, though some tracks feel reminiscent of popular 

scores, which is a slight drawback.
</pre>

        <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
On the whole, Arjun S/o Vyjayanthi is a watchable emotional action drama that stands out for its lead 

performances by Kalyan Ram and Vijayashanti. While the storyline is familiar, its execution keeps it 

watchable.

Some emotional scenes could have been better written, and a few exaggerated moments might not work 

for everyone. But if you’re someone who enjoys action films with a touch of emotion, this film is 

worth a watch this weekend.
