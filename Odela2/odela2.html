    <h4>Milky Beauty Tamannaah Bhatia’s supernatural thriller Odela 2, the sequel to the 2022 OTT release Odela, hit the big screens today amidst decent buzz. Directed by Ashok Teja and penned by Sampath Nandi, the film carries moderate expectations. Let’s see how it fares.</h4>

    <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
In the village of Odela, the corpse of rapist-murderer Tirupathi (Vasishta) is sealed by the villagers.

Six months later, his vengeful spirit returns, terrorizing the village again. 

Women start dying mysteriously. The villagers seek help from Bhairavi (Tamannaah Bhatia), a powerful Shiva Shakti, 

to stop the evil spirit.

Why was Tirupathi really killed? What is Bhairavi’s link to Odela? 

How does the final spiritual showdown unfold? These questions drive the plot.
</pre>

    <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Vasishta Simha is effective as the villain. His face-offs with Tamannaah in the second half 

are the film’s highlights.

Tamannaah as Bhairavi gives a sincere performance. Though her role appears late, 

she dominates the latter half. Some of her climax scenes are impactful.

A few sequences, like the murders and the Shiva-themed climax, are executed well 

and deliver some chills.
</pre>

    <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
The story is too thin and highly predictable. The spiritual battle between good and evil 

lacks emotional depth and surprise.

Ashok Teja’s execution of Sampath Nandi’s script is weak. The pacing is off, and the 

screenplay lacks suspense and intensity.

Tamannaah’s role, though central, feels miscast at times and underdeveloped. 

The emotional layers could have been richer.

Unnecessary songs and slow narration drag the film. Characters like Murali Sharma 

are wasted with underwritten roles.
</pre>

    <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Ajaneesh Loknath’s music provides some mood but fails to elevate key moments.

Cinematography by Soundararajan is decent. Editing by Avinash needed more tightness—

several scenes feel stretched.

VFX is average, and though the production values are okay, nothing visually stands out.

Direction is underwhelming—emotional scenes lack punch, and the horror setup never 

feels truly gripping.
</pre>

    <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
Overall, Odela 2 is a supernatural thriller that has a few gripping moments but is mostly 

let down by its weak story, predictable twists, and flat narration.

Tamannaah and Vasishta do their best, but the film doesn’t offer anything new in the 

horror-thriller space. Watch only with low expectations.
