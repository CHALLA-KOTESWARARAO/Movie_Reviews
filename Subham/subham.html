    <h4>Actress Samantha’s debut production venture Subham directed by Praveen Kandregula, is now in theatres. Here’s the full review.</h4>

    <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
Set in the early 2000s in Bheemili, the story follows Srinivas (Harshith Reddy), a cable TV operator who marries Srivalli (Shriya Kontham), 

an educated MBA graduate. Their married life is disrupted when Srivalli starts behaving oddly every night at 9 PM. 

Soon, other women in the village show similar behavior. 

Srinivas digs deeper and uncovers a spooky pattern linked to a mysterious phenomenon.

What’s behind the strange change in behavior? 

What secrets are hidden in the village?
</pre>

    <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Subham has a fresh premise using a nostalgic TV serial as the plot device. 

The horror-comedy mix is entertaining, especially for family and female audiences.

Harshith and Shriya display good chemistry, and their natural performances make their bond believable. 

Srinivas Gavireddy and Charan Peri add comic flair with their fun scenes.

Shalini Kondepudi and Shravani Lakshmi steal the show in their supporting roles, 

delivering humor and emotion in equal measure.
</pre>

    <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
While the story concept is strong, the execution stumbles midway. 

The pacing slows down, and a few sequences feel repetitive and fail to engage.

Some character arcs are underdeveloped. 

The writing could have offered more depth and emotion to increase audience investment.

Samantha’s cameo fails to impress and feels unnecessary. 

Her performance lacks impact, and her scenes don't add much to the story.

Casting for a few supporting roles could have been better.
</pre>

    <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Director Praveen Kandregula mixes horror and comedy decently, 

but struggles with consistency in storytelling. 

Mridul Sujit Sen’s cinematography is apt and adds style. 

Vivek Sagar’s score sets the mood effectively. 

Editing by Dharmendra Kakarala could have been sharper—

a few scenes linger longer than needed. 

Production quality suits the tone of the film.
</pre>

    <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
All in all, Subham is a breezy, horror-comedy with an enjoyable family tone. 

It has its highs in comedy and concept but is held back by weak pacing and a forgettable cameo.
