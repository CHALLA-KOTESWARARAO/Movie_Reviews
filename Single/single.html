    <h4>Sree Vishnu’s latest film, Single, has hit the big screens with plenty of buzz. Let’s see how it holds up in this review.</h4>

    <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
Vijay (Sree Vishnu) is a bank employee who falls in love with Purva Nettem (Ketika Sharma) at first sight.

He attempts to win her love, but Harini (Ivana), who is already in love with Vijay, starts following him.

As the story progresses, truths are revealed about Harini and Purva, 

and the film follows what unfolds in Vijay’s love life.
</pre>

    <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Sree Vishnu delivers once again with his comic timing and humorous use of trending memes and dialogues. 

Vennela Kishore joins him to form a hilarious duo that carries the film’s entertainment.

Ketika Sharma plays a simple role effectively, stepping away from her usual glamorous image.

Ivana, on the other hand, plays a mischievous character who adds flavor to the comedy.

The comedy scenes between Sree Vishnu and Vennela Kishore work in both halves, 

making the film enjoyable despite a weak storyline.

VTV Ganesh brings laughs in his brief screen time. Other supporting actors are fine in their roles.
</pre>

    <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
While comedy works, the film lacks a strong narrative to support it. 

The storyline feels weak and serves only as a base for jokes.

The first half loses pace quickly, and the second half follows suit, dragging in some parts.

The characters of Ketika and Ivana could have been better developed to add more emotional depth.

VTV Ganesh and Rajendra Prasad are underutilized. The emotional elements don’t land well 

due to the comedy-heavy structure.

Songs are forgettable and do not add value to the viewing experience.
</pre>

    <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Director Caarthick Raju successfully delivers on the comedy front but neglects the story and screenplay.

Cinematography by Velraj is neat. Music and score by Vishal Chandrasekhar are average.

Editing is acceptable but could have benefited from trimming a few scenes in the second half.

Production values are solid, giving the film a polished visual look.
</pre>

    <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
Overall, Single is a lighthearted comedy film that delivers good laughs, 

thanks to the performances of Sree Vishnu and Vennela Kishore.

Though the film lacks a strong story and has pacing issues, 

it works as a weekend entertainer for those who enjoy comedy-driven movies.

Watch it with low expectations for the narrative, and you’ll have a fun time.
