        <h4>After the success of Tillu Square, Siddhu Jonnalagadda is back with his new film Jack. Directed by ‘Bommarillu’ Bhaskar, the film features Vaishnavi Chaitanya as the female lead and is produced by BVSN Prasad. Read our review to find out whether the film lives up to the hype.</h4>

        <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre>
Jack (Siddhu Jonnalagadda) is a highly skilled individual who doesn’t believe in full-time jobs. 

He dreams of becoming a RAW agent and believes he's selected after an interview.

Meanwhile, a terrorist plot is in motion, and Jack embarks on a mission to stop it. 

RAW agents also race to catch a dreaded terrorist.

How Jack becomes part of RAW and helps stop the plot forms the crux of the story.
</pre>

        <h2>Plus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Siddhu Jonnalagadda is the soul of the film. His comic timing, dialogue delivery, and screen presence 

keep the film engaging despite the outdated plot.

Prakash Raj is decent in a limited role. The first-half comedy, especially scenes between Siddhu and 

Naresh, works to an extent.

Action scenes around Charminar and a mistaken kidnapping sequence are executed well. 

The idea of a local man aspiring to join RAW is established convincingly.
</pre>

        <h2>Minus Points:</h2>
<pre>
Interesting premise, but poor execution. The second half lacks seriousness and collapses completely.

RAW agents are shown as incompetent, relying entirely on Jack, which feels unrealistic and forced.

Vaishnavi Chaitanya’s role is weak and forced into the plot, with no chemistry between the leads.

The Nepal operation and terrorist angle feel exaggerated and unconvincing. 

Logical flaws reduce the impact of the storyline.
</pre>

        <h2>Technical Aspects:</h2>
<pre>
Production values are good, especially RAW sets and visuals. 

Music is disappointing — no memorable tracks. 

Editing in the second half is patchy, and VFX appears weak.

Dialogues are the strong point — sharp and effective. 

Director Bhaskar fails to move past outdated style. The blend of terrorism and comedy fails due 

to poor execution.
</pre>

        <h2>Verdict:</h2>
<pre>
On the whole, Jack is a weak action-comedy that fails in key areas. 

Siddhu Jonnalagadda shines, but he alone can’t save the film.

If you're a fan of his performance, there may be a few enjoyable moments. 

Otherwise, Jack ends up being a below-par watch this week.
